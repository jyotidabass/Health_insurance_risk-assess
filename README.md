The present study proposes the use of artificial neural networks for risk assessment in the health insurance industry. A two-stage decision support model was devised using a Kohonen self-organizing map and applying PCA to reduce the dimension of our dataset. As second stage we applied a multilayer feed-forward network in order to make the risk assessment process more effective and accurate.

ANN model seem to be outperforming traditional statistical approaches on predicting of people’s health condition,especially when trained with a huge various data

# Importance of risk assessement in health insurance
Health care insurance is a financial structure that work against the risk of future medical expenses of individuals. By predicting the health risk of the insured, insurance actuary tries to match supported risk with a fee called premium. In case of damage, the insurer will provide health care benefits to the individuals who pay the premium. 

In this context risk assessment is critical for health insurance, the risk associated with a claim depends on many variables about the potential customer, and there is a nonlinear relationship between customer’s specifications and amount of his/her future claim. Utilizing AI and advances in data analytics we try to make the job of an insurance actuary much easier in analyzing and anticipating health risk for potential claims expenses.


# Health Insurance dataset
To show how neural networks works on predicting risk related to healthcare insurance, we run a neural network model by a set of data of 100 customer’s personal information. This dataset is simulated following a normal distribution and global statistical census of Hong Kong in 2018 in https://www.dh.gov.hk/english/statistics/statistics_hs/files/Health_Statistics_pamphlet_E.pdf
